# Ax Framework Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating the capabilities of the Ax framework.

## Teacher-Student Optimization Example (MiPRO)

The main example demonstrates using a large teacher model (Gemini Pro) to optimize a small student model (SmolLM:360m) for complex algorithm implementation tasks.

## Multi-Objective Optimization Example (GEPA)

A compelling demonstration of GEPA's unique multi-objective optimization capabilities, showing how it finds optimal trade-offs between conflicting objectives like quality vs speed in code review tasks.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd src/ax
npm run tsx src/examples/gepa-quality-vs-speed-optimization.ts
```

**Prerequisites:** OpenAI API key (`OPENAI_APIKEY` environment variable)

## Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) Example

End-to-end walkthrough of the ACE optimizer that grows a structured playbook through generator → reflector → curator loops. The example trains offline on support ticket severities and then performs an online update after a new incident.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd src/ax
npm run tsx src/examples/ace-train-inference.ts
```

**Prerequisites:** OpenAI API key (`OPENAI_APIKEY` environment variable)

### Quick Start

1. **Automated Setup** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   # Start all required services automatically
   ./scripts/start-teacher-student-demo.sh
   
   # In another terminal, run the example
   cd src/ax
   npm run tsx src/examples/teacher-student-optimization.ts
   ```

2. **Manual Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Start Ollama
   ollama serve
   ollama pull smollm:360m
   
   # Start Python optimizer
   cd src/optimizer
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Run example
   cd ../ax
   npm run tsx src/examples/teacher-student-optimization.ts
   ```

### Prerequisites

- **Ollama**: Install from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For Python optimizer service
- **Google AI API Key**: Set `GOOGLE_APIKEY` environment variable
- **Node.js 20+**: For running the TypeScript example

### What the Example Demonstrates

- **Teacher-Student Learning**: Large model (Gemini Pro) guides optimization of small model (SmolLM:360m)
- **Complex Task**: Algorithm implementation requiring understanding of data structures, edge cases, and Python syntax
- **MiPRO Optimization**: Uses the MiPRO optimizer with Python backend for advanced optimization algorithms
- **Before/After Comparison**: Shows improvement in the small model's capabilities
- **Real-world Scenario**: Demonstrates how to make small models perform complex tasks they initially can't handle

### Expected Output

The example will show:
1. Initial poor performance of the small model on algorithm implementation
2. MiPRO optimization process with progress updates (requires Python service)
3. Significantly improved performance after optimization
4. Concrete examples of generated algorithm implementations

**Note**: The example requires the Python optimizer service to be running. Without it, the optimization will fail with a clear error message.

### Architecture

└─────────────────┘               └─────────────────┘
```

The teacher model provides high-quality examples and guidance, while the Python optimizer service uses advanced algorithms (TPE, Bayesian optimization) to find the best prompts and configurations to improve the student model's performance.

## What the GEPA Example Demonstrates

- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Simultaneously optimizes for quality (thoroughness) and speed (conciseness)
- **Pareto Frontier Discovery**: Finds multiple optimal solutions instead of just one "best" solution
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Shows the inherent tension between conflicting objectives
- **Real-world Application**: Code review task where you might want different trade-offs for different scenarios
- **Hypervolume Metrics**: Quantifies improvement across the entire objective space
- **Solution Selection**: Choose the optimal point based on your specific requirements

### GEPA vs MiPRO Comparison

| Aspect | MiPRO | GEPA |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Objectives** | Single (composite score) | Multiple (Pareto frontier) |
| **Output** | One "best" solution | Set of optimal trade-offs |
| **Use Case** | Clear single goal | Conflicting objectives |
| **Optimization** | Teacher-student + Python backend | Reflective evolution |
| **Selection** | Automatic best | User chooses from frontier |

### GEPA Advantages

1. **No Objective Weighting**: You don't need to decide upfront how to balance objectives
2. **Multiple Solutions**: Get a range of optimal choices for different scenarios
3. **Trade-off Visibility**: See exactly what you gain/lose when prioritizing one objective
4. **Robust Solutions**: Pareto-optimal solutions are mathematically guaranteed to be optimal
5. **Future-Proof**: As requirements change, you can select different points from the same frontier

### Troubleshooting

- **Ollama connection issues**: Ensure Ollama is running on port 11434
- **Python service issues**: Check `docker-compose logs` in `src/optimizer/`
- **API key issues**: Verify `GOOGLE_APIKEY` is set correctly
- **Model download**: SmolLM:360m download may take a few minutes on first run

### Customization

You can modify the example to:
- Use different teacher/student model pairs
- Try different complex tasks (code generation, reasoning, creative writing)
- Adjust MiPRO optimization parameters
- Experiment with different evaluation metrics
