Hello Support Team,

I am writing to report an issue with my recent order #12345. I received the package yesterday, but unfortunately, the product that I paid for with cash (XYZ Smartwatch) is not functioning properly. When I tried to turn it on, the screen remained blank, and I couldn't get it to respond to any of the buttons.

I have already tried resetting the device multiple times, but the issue persists. I believe there may be a defect with the product, and I would like to request a replacement or refund. Please let me know what steps I should take to proceed with the return or exchange process. I have attached a copy of the order confirmation and shipping confirmation for your reference.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
John Doe.
