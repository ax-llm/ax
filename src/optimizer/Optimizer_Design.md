The best modern Python stack for building an HTTP service around Optuna is
centered around **FastAPI** for the web framework and a (optional) dedicated
task queue like **ARQ** for handling the long-running optimization jobs.

** It should mostly run in memory but have optional support for persistance **

## The Core Stack

Optuna (The Top Recommendation) Optuna is a modern, actively developed
hyperparameter optimization framework. Its TPE implementation is robust and easy
to use, and it's the default sampler, so you get it right out of the box.

Why it's the best:

Easy & Intuitive API: The code is clean, imperative, and easy to read.

Excellent Visualization: Generate plots for optimization history, parameter
importance, and more with single lines of code.

Pruning: It can automatically stop unpromising trials early, saving significant
time and computational resources.

Active Development: It's constantly being updated with new features and
improvements.

Flexibility: Easily switch between different samplers (TPE, CMA-ES, Random
Search) to compare their performance.

Example of Optuna:

Python

import optuna

# 1. Define the objective function to minimize

def objective(trial): # Suggest hyperparameters using the trial object x =
trial.suggest_float('x', -10, 10) y = trial.suggest_categorical('y', ['a', 'b',
'c'])

    # Calculate the value to minimize
    return (x - 2) ** 2

# 2. Create a study object and optimize

# By default, Optuna uses a TPESampler

study = optuna.create_study(direction='minimize') study.optimize(objective,
n_trials=100)

# 3. Get the best results

print("Best trial:") trial = study.best_trial

print(f" Value: {trial.value}") print(" Params: ") for key, value in
trial.params.items(): print(f" {key}: {value}")

# You can even plot the results easily

# optuna.visualization.plot_optimization_history(study).show()

### FastAPI and Pydantic

**FastAPI** is the ideal choice for your API framework. It's a high-performance
web framework built specifically for creating modern, asynchronous APIs.

- **Why it's best:**
  - **Asynchronous:** It's built on `asyncio`, which is essential for handling
    long-running background tasks without blocking your server.
  - **Fast:** One of the fastest Python web frameworks available.
  - **Automatic Docs:** It automatically generates interactive API documentation
    (Swagger UI), which makes testing and sharing your service incredibly easy.
- **Pydantic** is integrated directly into FastAPI and is used to define your
  data models using standard Python type hints. It handles all the data
  validation, serialization, and documentation for your API requests and
  responses.

## Handling Long-Running Optuna Jobs

An Optuna study can take minutes or hours to run. You can't have an HTTP request
hang for that long. The solution is to use a background task queue.

### ARQ

Your HTTP endpoint should receive the optimization request, immediately start a
job in the background, and return a `job_id`. A dedicated task queue is the
professional way to manage these jobs.

- **ARQ (Asyncio and Redis Queue):** ⚡ A simpler, modern alternative designed
  specifically for `asyncio` applications. If you want a lighter setup that
  pairs perfectly with FastAPI, ARQ is an excellent choice.

## Storing Your Optimization Results

To make your service robust, you need to persist the Optuna study data. If your
server restarts, you don't want to lose your optimization history.

### Optuna Storage + SQLAlchemy

Optuna has built-in support for persistent storage. Instead of keeping the study
in memory, you connect it to a database.

- **How it works:** You provide a database URL when creating your study. Optuna
  uses **SQLAlchemy** under the hood to connect to databases like **PostgreSQL**
  (for production) or **SQLite** (for simple development).

<!-- end list -->

```python
# Example of creating a persistent study
study = optuna.create_study(
    study_name="my_optimization_job_123",
    storage="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database",
    load_if_exists=True # Resume study if it already exists
)
```

## Essential Tooling

- **Uvicorn:** The recommended high-performance ASGI server for running your
  FastAPI application.
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** Essential for packaging your FastAPI app, the ARQ
  worker, a Redis instance, and a PostgreSQL database into manageable services
  for easy development and deployment.

## Example Workflow

Putting it all together, here’s how the service would work:

1. A client sends a `POST` request to your `/optimize` endpoint.
2. **FastAPI** validates the incoming data with a **Pydantic** model.
3. An optimization task is created and sent to your **ARQ** queue.
4. FastAPI immediately responds with a `job_id`, e.g., `{"job_id": "xyz-123"}`.
5. A separate worker process picks up the job from the queue and starts the
   Optuna study, saving the results to your **PostgreSQL** database.
6. The client can then poll a `/status/{job_id}` endpoint to check the progress
   or retrieve the final results once the study is complete.
